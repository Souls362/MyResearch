Since Transfomer is so successful in NLP tasks, lots of the researchers considering user behavior sequence (click/order/search/follow...) as another format of word sequence which makes it quite popular for applying NLP methods on user representation tasks. 

- Paper1: 

- Paper2: Contrastive Learning User Encoder between different **Services**(No clear definition)? (BST like structure)

- Paper3: **Data augmentation** with crop/shuffle sequence, doing **MLM** **pretraining** with multi tasks: category / date prediction

- Paper4: **Contrastive learning** with behvior sequence matching / masked behvior prediction, tricky on getting negative samples

- Paper5: Pretraining with **Masked Item Prediction** / **User Attribute Prediction** / **Social Relation Detection** 

- Paper6: Pretraining with MLM

- Paper7: Pretraining using LSTM with MLM

  

## Training Objectives

- **AutoRegressive**(masked multi-head attention):

  given a list of interactions(items), predict the last interaction(item) $x$ with previous $x-1$ inteactions

- **AutoEncoder**:

  give a list of interactions(items) with length $n$, randomly mask interaction(item) $1 \le x < n$, predict the masked interaction.

  hidden output may differ with models:

  - Use CLS
  - Use hidden output of masked item
  - Adding Negative Samples 
  - Adding additional info, order time / category / price bucket and etc with more masked prediction objectives

- **Contrastive**:

  - given a list of interactions(items), random sample two sub lists from origin list. give preidction for the outputs of two sub lists.
  - given a list of interactions(items), premuatation the list getting a new interaction list, give preidction for the outputs of two  lists.
